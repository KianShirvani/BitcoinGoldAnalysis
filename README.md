# Raw Datasets: #

***GOLD DATA***


This dataset tracks monthly gold prices from January 1950 to July 2020. Gold has served as a store of value and medium of exchange for centuries and continues to play a key role in financial markets. Various factors, including global economic conditions, geopolitical events, and supply-demand dynamics, influence its price. The dataset includes 847 entries provided by The World Gold Council

***BTC DATA***

This dataset shows Bitcoin prices starting from October 5, 2009, when its first exchange value was set by the New Liberty Standard. Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency, created as a digital currency that doesn’t rely on banks or governments. Its price changes based on factors like how many people are using it, market trends, regulations, and the economy. The dataset tracks Bitcoin’s growth from its early days to becoming a major part of global finance.

***INTEREST RATE AND VIX DATA***

This dataset includes interest rates and the VIX, both important tools for understanding financial markets. Interest rates, set by central banks, influence borrowing costs and economic activity. When rates rise, borrowing gets more expensive, which can lower spending and investment. When they drop, the economy often speeds up. These changes affect the value of assets like Bitcoin and Gold.

The VIX, known as the "fear index," measures how much volatility investors expect in the stock market. High VIX levels usually mean uncertainty or fear in the market, often during recessions or crises. By including interest rates and VIX data, we can see how economic conditions and market stress impact Bitcoin and Gold prices over time.

# Goal of Analysis - *Is Bitcoin a Hedge During a Recession Similar to Gold?* #

In this analysis, I examine whether Bitcoin acts as a hedge during recessions, similar to how gold is traditionally viewed. Gold has long been seen as a safe haven during economic uncertainty, while Bitcoin’s role is still debated.

I compare Bitcoin and gold by looking at features like their prices, volatility, and performance during key recession periods. To understand how they respond to economic changes, I include factors like interest rates and the VIX. Interest rates show how central bank policies impact the economy, while the VIX measures market fear and uncertainty. By combining these factors, my analysis aims to see if Bitcoin, like gold, provides stability and value during times of economic hardship.
